                Development of Django is supported by an independent 
                foundation established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. Like 
                most open-source foundations, the goal of the Django 
                Software Foundation is to promote, support, and advance 
                its open-source project: in our case, the Django Web 
                framework.
